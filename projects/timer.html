						<p class="light center-align fade-inUp-element">Team Timer is an app developed from necessity. As a coach for a youth triathlon team, I and the other coaches struggled with a way to record athletes' workouts during a training session. Very often we run a workout where all the athletes of a particlar training group start together and complete the same number of laps. Despite utilizing multiple stopwatches, clipboards, and other methods, recording each athlete's lap time, while also trying to convey to each athlete their progress, became frustratingly difficult. Thus, Team Timer was born!</p>

It has since been refactored and deployed for use by coaches of the AERO youth triathlon team. Many features have been added, and more are being developed as the app is being put through its' first season of training.
